# Logistic Regression on Food Items Dataset

This project explores multiclass classification using Logistic Regression on a food dataset. It evaluates the impact of regularization (L1/L2) and data balancing methods (SMOTE, Oversampling, Undersampling) on classification metrics.

## Highlights
- Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC compared across 14+ model variants
- Data preprocessing includes outlier removal and Box-Cox normalization
- Visualizations: Confusion Matrices, ROC/PR Curves
